# Timer App

This application should display a list of timers to start.

There should be four timers to choose from, represented by buttons.

- 5 Minutes
- 10 Minutes
- 15 Minutes
- 75 Minutes

When the user hovers over a button, it should show the time the timer would expire if the button was clicked.

When the user clicks a button, it starts a timer with the correct number of minutes.

While the timer is running, it shows:

What time the timer was started.
What time the timer will expire.
A countdown of minutes and seconds until the timer expires.

It should also have a button the cancel the timer.
